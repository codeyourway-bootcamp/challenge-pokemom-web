## Pok√©mon Challenge [Web Version]

### Challenge for a Junior Web/Mobile Developer (Trainee)


## The Task ‚úÖ

### Develop 3 Pok√©mon-related screens using the Poke API:

First Screen: Static One just with the Images and the Button to navigate to the second screen.

Second Screen: Create a web page that lists all the Pok√©mon available from the following endpoint: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon. Include a search input on this page that filters the Pok√©mon list displayed on the screen without making additional API calls.

Third Screen: Create another web page that displays the details of the Pok√©mon selected from the first screen. For example, you'll need to capture the Pok√©mon's ID to fetch details from an endpoint like this: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/.

Key Points: üîë
