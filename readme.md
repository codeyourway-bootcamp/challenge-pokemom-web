# Pok√©mon Challenge
## Challenge for a Junior Mobile Engineer (Trainee)

### The Task ‚úÖ

#### Develop 2 Pok√©mon-related screens using the Poke API:
1. **First Screen**: This should list all the Pok√©mon available from the following endpoint: [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon)
   - Include a search input on this screen. This input should filter the Pok√©mon list displayed on the screen without making additional API calls.

2. **Second Screen**: Display the details of the Pok√©mon selected from the first screen. For example, you'll need to capture the Pok√©mon's ID to fetch details from an endpoint like this: [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/)

#### Key Points: üîë

- Provide comprehensive documentation in the `readme.md`.
- Ensure the application is free of bugs/errors.
- Maintain a well-structured and clean codebase.
- Make frequent commits with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Create a repository on GitHub and share the link with the recruiter/manager.

#### Requirements: ‚Äº

- Utilize Expo. [Create your first app with Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/)
- Implement with TypeScript. [Expo with TypeScript](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/)
- Use React Navigation for screen transitions. [React Navigation with Expo](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/#installing-dependencies-into-an-expo-managed-project)
- Style the app using styled-components. [Styled components with React Native](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-styled-components-with-react-native/)
- Make API requests using Axios. [Axios with React Native](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-axios-with-react-native-manage-api-requests/)
- Implement React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) where necessary.

üö® Pay close attention to the design details.

#### Tips üí°
- Do all the logic and componentization first, all working and API consuming is good, and move to the design tasks.
- The pokemon Images (3D) you can find on the `sprites` with the name `shiny` on it , follow the example below:
